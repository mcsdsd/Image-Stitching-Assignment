# Image-Stitching-Assignment

Assignment I made during my third year of university at the University of Sheffield where I coded a UI that grabs two images of the same environment but from two different angles and stitches them together to create a panorama.

All code was done in python and it is in the file called assignment.py. I have included the sample set I used for the assignment but in theory the code I have written should work with any two pictures so long as they share 70% of their content, so if you wish to donwload this and use it to create your own panoramas you should be able to.
